# Elevation Infinity

APCS A D 2021-22 final project.

## Overall Notes

Overall, I had a ton of ideas but the project itself was too ambitious.  
There were a ton of things I simply did not have the time to do.  
I got some basic functionality down so that the game works, but there is not much to do in the game.

## Functionality

- Infinite level generation
- Level colors
- Player movement
- UI
- Level restarts

## To-Dos

- Trick system and scoring
    I was not able to implement this because Unity handles rotations in quaternions instead of vectors.  
    I tried to learn about how to work with quaternions, but in the end I ran out of time.  
- Coins
- High scores through file saves
- Randomly generated decorations/obstacles

## Known Issues

- Background generation has increasingly frequent artifacts
